- It may be that human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be too rarefied for us to breathe. Certainly I wouldn't be writing this book, on this subject, if living with freedom were easy. The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demostrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

- A professional schools himself to stand aprat from his performance, even as he gives to it his heart and soul. The Bhagavad-Gita tells us we have a right only to our labour, not to the fruits of our labor. All a warrior can give is his life; all the athelete can do is leave everything on the field.
