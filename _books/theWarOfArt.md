- It may be that human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be too rarefied for us to breathe. Certainly I wouldn't be writing this book, on this subject, if living with freedom were easy. The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demostrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

- A professional schools himself to stand aprat from his performance, even as he gives to it his heart and soul. The Bhagavad-Gita tells us we have a right only to our labour, not to the fruits of our labor. All a warrior can give is his life; all the athelete can do is leave everything on the field. 

- There is no mystry to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.   

- "The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage. - Xenophon, (The Cavalry Commander)
